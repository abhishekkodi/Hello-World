From Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution to Zahavi's handicap principle. The essentially ground braking ideas revolve very much beyond the horion of plain sight.
Such is the assumption of my efforts to iterate, reiterate and discover the essence of a format of implementation... programming. The ideas of
designing systems that fall into a corner of class of systems that scratch the surface of awareness and conciousness.

The lens of past in a limited manner does provide the path to imaginary future and its aspects. The proportion are off and directed by forces not just vast in intensity rather vastness of the very number of them. Onc essence fo neural networks arises from utilizing the vastness of the 
number of forces, or in other words incemental nature of dimensionality.

Autoencoders and variational Autoencoders are fundamentaaly a very powerful  idea in my opinion as they maintain the symmetry of a circle. Their nature of beginning with and element and transforming into components and elemental states to again revert back to its original state is essentially a supra-effective methordology of logic and understanding.

The simple metaphors that help me imagine their capabilities are visualization of concentric circles with a common midpoint(head). realistically ellipses with focal points. 
The other manner to imagine the autoencoders would be stationary waves with varying harmonic values.

The value of lossless symmetry can lead to whole class of models address a singular objective, which can be optimized in different pathways of gradient descent. 

Now, a thougt experiment extension to the idea is the an elctrons behaviour in an atom. existing in banded zones of high probability. 
Think of an agent as an electron attempting to exist stably in an atom and you could have mutiple elements in an atom thus multiple agents attempting to addess same problem, leading to a solution.
An energy surge would be the more data to train or validate
