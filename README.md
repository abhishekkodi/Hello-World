# Hello-World
This repository shall contain preemptive ideas and concepts

Multiple branches are designated to main stramlined structure to ideas.
Running diaries shall is a branch the shall be merged into the master branch.


Data collection in itself is a huge task and normalizing the data plays a key role. 
One step is to understand and compile best practices for the data collection and preparation.


For organised data.(Data organization os an art rather tha science)

Building a standardized pipeline to bring to a grade value of data shall make it easy and prevent irrelvant red tape in data
testing and implementation of machine learning alorithms.

Data holder form from pandas.
Tabular SQL form architewcture.
Hadoop and MongoDB form of architecture.

Initial range of data probing in a statistical and visual form.


Applying the standard set of scikit-learn algorithms to test out the proclivity of the data.

Naive Bayes
Data tree
KNN
Nearest Neghbour
Regression

next step would be to prioritize the some model boost to optimize the specific models while visualizing the 
senitivity and varible change. Isolating each varibale may be challenging but critical variables need to be
isolated and played with.


Parameters that measure the overfitting of the model.
Efficiency
Effectiveness 


Now the resultant model should be categorized into:
1) Known Knowns
2) KNown Unknowns
3) Unknown Knowns
3)Unknown Unknowns


Building the pseudo theory behind the conceptual variables and they types


Visualzing the final results in multibased perceptions.
